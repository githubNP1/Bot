# RunescapeBot

-The BuyingBot2 class is used to repeatedly buy certain items so they can be processed and resold for profit.
-The Typer class which is used in the BuyingBot2 class is used to type in a way that is random so that it looks like a human is typing. This is used because the game moniters your activity and is actively looking for unnatural behavior which may be the cause of a bot.
-The Abyss and Herblore classes are simple programs that carry out simple and repetitive tasks related to certain skills. They allow players to train for hours at a time without any input, so they can spend that time doing something else in real life.
